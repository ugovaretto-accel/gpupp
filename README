C++ wrapper for CUDA and OpenCL APIs to ease the task of setting up environments,
managing resources, invoking kernels and handling errors.
Advanced (i.e. messy and unreadable) compile and run time C++ techniques 
are used to hide low level details to client code.
This code was used with CUDA 3.x and OpenCL 1.0/1.1.
